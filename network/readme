Network part, used for multiplayer games.
Using TCP.
Linux Friendly (no use of Winsockets or what :) ).

When a Client click on "Multiplayer" through the GUI,
we will call MultiplayerGame.cpp, not Game.cpp.

2 options :
 - The Server creates its own game. Each time a Client wants do to smth,
    he tells the Server. Server do the play on his own game, then Broadcast
    the information.
    It is the most secure way to do it. As Clients can't cheat.
    However, it is more complicated to implement.

 - Here, Clients play on their own game, then they send the information
    of what happend to the Server, which Broadcast it to the others.
    In this version, each Client executes the actions on his own instance
    of the game. Which also means if someone can modify the code, he can
    do whatever he wants. Although this looks bad, it is more simple to
    implement. That's why we chose this option.

Each action is played on Client side, then he sends new players/game 's information
to the server, which sends it to the others clients. Here the server only stocks information.

Where is the server ?
    - Good question.
        For now, we admit that each Client can host the server. He only has to
        give his ip to the others who wants to join.

    Additional :
        - He can also define maximum player numbers
        - Set password to be able to host private games

Hosting the server is basically calling "./server" on the Client machine.
